# 📚 Bookstore E2E Automation Framework

This project is a production-style end-to-end (E2E) test automation framework for an eCommerce bookstore, built using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and TypeScript.

It covers realistic scenarios such as browsing, searching for books, adding to basket, and completing a checkout flow. My goal for this project is to demonstrate scalable test practices suitable for real-world QA pipelines that would be used as a software automation tester.
